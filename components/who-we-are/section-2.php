            <p>RGS College of Pharmacy opened its gates to aspiring pharma students in the year 2019. The foundations of
                the
                College were laid on the belief that students anywhere and everywhere should have access to quality
                education
                and be provided with superior infrastructure and campus life in their own State.</p>

            <p>At RGS College of Pharmacy, we are fortunate enough to be under guidance of acclaimed and prolific
                academicians and professionals who impart knowledge to our future researchers and pharmacists. Our
                Principal, Faculty Members and teachers come with rich and reputed experiences and are dedicated to
                educating, guiding and moulding our students.</p>

            <p>Being in our initial years, we are providing comprehensive Pharma Courses including Bachelors of Pharmacy
                (B.Pharma) and Diploma in Pharmacy (D. Pharma). Our
                Principal, Faculty Members and teachers come with rich and reputed experiences and are dedicated to
                educating, guiding and moulding our students.</p>

            <p>Our on-Campus, quality and well equipped Labs, Library, Practical Rooms enable our Students to learn and
                master their concepts and become better and credible additions to the Pharma Sector. #GoPhar with us!
            </p>

            <p>At RGSCP, we believe in giving our students interactive exposure in form of regular seminars, workshops &
                symposiums. Our staff members regularly attend training programs/seminars to keep themselves abreast of
                the latest developments in the Pharmacy sector and Teaching modules. Scientific papers are published in
                reputed journals periodically and are presented at National & International conferences by staff
                members.</p>

            <p>The college environment focuses on inculcating essential values like constructive competition, honesty &
                dedication towards profession in our students.</p>

            <p>At RGS College of Pharmacy: Academics, Discipline, Dedication and Determination move like four wheels of
