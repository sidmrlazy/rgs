                    <p>The Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry is a key component of pharmaceutical education and
                        research. It focuses on the study of chemical aspects related to drug discovery, development,
                        and analysis. Pharmaceutical chemists play a crucial role in designing and synthesizing new drug
                        molecules, optimizing their chemical properties for improved efficacy and safety. They also work
                        on developing analytical methods to ensure the quality, purity, and stability of pharmaceutical
                        products. The Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry combines knowledge from various
                        disciplines, such as organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and analytical chemistry, to
                        contribute to the advancement of the pharmaceutical industry and the development of new
                        therapeutic agents for the benefit of patients.</p>
