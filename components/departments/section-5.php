                    <p>The Department of Pharmacognosy is a specialized field within pharmacy that focuses on the study
                        of natural products derived from plants, animals, and microorganisms. Pharmacognosists
                        investigate the chemical, biological, and pharmacological properties of these natural substances
                        to identify potential therapeutic compounds. They explore traditional medicinal practices,
                        ethnobotany, and the isolation, identification, and characterization of bioactive compounds.
                        Pharmacognosy plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, contributing to the
                        creation of novel medicines and the understanding of their mechanisms of action. The Department
                        of Pharmacognosy combines traditional knowledge with modern scientific techniques to unlock the
                        therapeutic potential of natural products for the benefit of human health.</p>
