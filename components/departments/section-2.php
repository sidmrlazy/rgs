                    <p>The Department of Pharmaceutics is a vital component of pharmaceutical education and research. It
                        focuses on the formulation, development, and optimization of pharmaceutical dosage forms to
                        ensure safe and effective drug delivery. The department plays a crucial role in bridging the gap
                        between drug discovery and clinical application by studying the principles of pharmaceutical
                        technology and applying them to practical drug formulations. Researchers and students in the
                        Department of Pharmaceutics work on various aspects of drug delivery systems, including drug
                        stability, bioavailability, controlled release, and novel drug delivery approaches. Their
                        efforts contribute to advancements in the pharmaceutical industry and improve patient outcomes
                        through enhanced drug delivery strategies.</p>
