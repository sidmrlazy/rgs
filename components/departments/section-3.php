                    <p>The Department of Pharmacology is a fundamental part of the field of medicine and pharmaceutical
                        sciences. It focuses on studying the effects of drugs on the body, understanding their
                        mechanisms of action, and evaluating their therapeutic benefits and potential risks.
                        Pharmacologists investigate how drugs interact with biological systems, including cells,
                        tissues, organs, and organisms. They conduct preclinical and clinical research to explore drug
                        efficacy, safety, and dosage regimens. The Department of Pharmacology plays a crucial role in
                        drug discovery and development, providing valuable insights into the pharmacokinetics,
                        pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics of various compounds. Its research contributes to the
                        advancement of medical treatments and the optimization of drug therapy for improved patient
                        care.</p>
