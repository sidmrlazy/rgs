                    <p>A naturally progressive industry, pharma has drawn together some great thinkers and speakers around the globe. However, did you know about itâ€™s debut in India?</p>
                    <p>In India, the formal pharmacy education - leading to a degree began with the introduction of the 3-year bachelors of pharmacy (BPharm) at Banaras Hindu University in the year 1937. </p>
                    <p>At that time, the curriculum was presented as a combination of pharmaceutical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and pharmacy, which prepared graduates to work as specialists in quality control and standardization of drugs for pharmaceutical companies, but not for pharmacy practices! </p>

                    <!-- <h2>The History of Pharmacy Education in India </h2> -->
                    <p>Before India gained independence in 1947, there were only 3 institutions offering pharmacy degree programs. In 1944, the Punjab University started a pharmacy department; in 1947 L.M. College was established in Ahmedabad. </p>
                    <p>Interestingly, the concept of pharmacy practice was not realized until after independence. In 1948, the Pharmacy Act was implemented as the nation's first minimum-standard of educational qualification required for pharmacy practices to regulate the practice, education, and profession of pharmacy. </p>
                    <p>Currently, one needs at least a diploma in pharmacy to practice as a pharmacist. Provisions of the Act are implemented through the Pharmacy Council of India (PCI).</p>
